# DistroPlus | Advanced Distributor Management Platform

A premium distributor management platform built with sophisticated administrative tools, hierarchical data structures, and advanced role-based access control.

We are developing the core system modules in the following order, ensuring each layer is robust and interconnected:

1.  **Roles and Permissions**
    *   Dynamic permission grid (CRUD mapping).
    *   Search and filter capabilities for module-specific access.
    *   Activity logging for role modifications.

2.  **Modules**
    *   Infinite hierarchical module structure (Root and Sub-modules).
    *   Priority-based positioning/sorting.
    *   Status management (Enable/Disable toggles).
    *   Full audit logs for structural changes.

3.  **User Management**
    *   Multi-tabbed profile management.
    *   Role assignment grid.
    *   Multiple contact and business location footprints.
    *   Security tracking (Login sessions & activity history).

4.  **Products**
    *   Nested Category and Product management.
    *   Hierarchical catalog structure.
    *   Inventory tracking and pricing management.
